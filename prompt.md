{Place your instructions here. You don’t need to reference `transcript.md` or `.github/instructions/workshop.instructions.md`, the default Copilot instructions already cover those.}

{When interacting with Copilot, simply ask it to "execute prompt.md instructions".}

{If it does not work as expected, reference try: "Use the .github/instructions/workshop.instructions.md instructions. Read transcript.md and execute the instructions from prompt.md." }
